1/ Declare = process of define the variable along with its type and names
Example: int id; where int is the type and id is the name

2/ Initialization = assign a value to the name.
Example: id = 1;

3/ Java data representation = primitive and references type.

4/ Primitive type = variable holds the value directly in the memory where the variable is allocated

5/ Reference type = hold references to object.
References = stores the memory address where the object is allocated + points to the object

6/ Create objects:
Initialization = using the new keyword -> allocate memory for the new object through constructor
Example: User user = new User("Hung")
-> allocate memory in the stack memory for the reference variable user which point to Object User with the "Hung" as the properties in the heap memory
Constructor = initialize the instance variables represent the main properties of the create object.
Example: public User(String name){
   this.name = name;
}
Overload = class can have many constructor with different number of parameter
