Overloading vs overriding:

Overloading = 2 methods have the same name but differ in the type of number of argument.
Ex:
public int foo(int hung);
public int foo(int hung, int chu);

Overriding = a method shares the same name and function signature as other methods in the super classes.

 Java does manipulate objects by reference, and all object variables are references.

 Call by Value and Call by reference
 C++ supports both call by value and call by reference.
 Java supports call by value only. There is no call by reference in java.

 Object-oriented
 C++ is an object-oriented language. However, in C language, single root hierarchy is not possible.
 Java is also an object-oriented language. However, everything (except fundamental types) is an object in Java.
 It is a single root hierarchy as everything gets derived from java.lang.Object.

 Memory management
 C++: Accessible to programmer
 Java: System controlled
