Modular programming = where we build libraries of static methods and a static method can call
static method in 1 library can call static method in other libraries

API:
1/ critical component of modular programming
2/ documents explains the operation of library methods that are intended to use by others
3/ application programming interface that lists the library name and signature and short description of
each methods
4/ list of constructor and instance method(operations) with informal describe
5/ clearly articulate the behaviours of all the possible outputs

public class Math
--------------------------------------
static double abs(double a)              absolute value of a
static double max(double a, double b)    max of a and b
