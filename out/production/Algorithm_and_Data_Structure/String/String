String = sequence of characters + immutable
Character = type of char and have 2^16 possible values
-> pay attention to characters encoded in 7-bit ASCII or 8-bit extended ASCII
charAt() = extract a character from a string, works in constant time

Numbers = represent number as string
radix = base of the number system
String has base 256 number(2^8)

String sort:
1/ LSD(least significant digit) string sort: examine the character in the keys in a right to
left order
2/ MSD(most significant digit) string sort: examine the characters in the keys in a left to right
order, work with the most significant character first
-> similar to quicksort since they partition the array into independent pieces such that the
array us completed by recursively applying the same method to sub array
-> MSD uses the first character of the sort key to partition
