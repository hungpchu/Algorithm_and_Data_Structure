A directed graph = set of vertices and a collection of directed edges.

outdegree of a vertex = number of edges going out from it

indegree of a vertex = number of edge going in to it.

first vertex = head

second vertex = tail

directed cycle = a directed path with at least one edge whose first and last
vertexes are the same

simple cycle = cycle with no repeated edges or vertices

the length of a path or cycle is the number of its edge

Topological sort = given the digraph, put the vertices in order such that
all the direct edges point from earliest vertices to the later vertex

directed acyclic graph (DAG) = a digraph with no directed cycles

A digraph has a topological order <=> it is a DAG

2 vertexes are strongly connected <=> they are mutually reachable, there is a directed path from v to w and w to v
                strongly connected <=> there is a directed cycle that contains them both
Digraph is strongly connected if all vertices are strongly connected to one other

Strongly connected component = maximal subset of vertices that are strongly connected to one another

Transitive closure of a digraph G = digraph with the same set of vertices but an edge from v to w in transitive closure <=> w is reachable from v in G

SHORTEST PATHS:

Shortest path from vertex s to vertex t = directed path from s to t with minimum weighted

Properties of shortest path:
Paths are directed
The weight are not the distance
Not all vertices need to be reached

Shortest path tree for a source s = subgraph containing all the vertices reachable from s and form the directed tree rooted at s and every tree path is a
shortest path in graph.
