A graph = set of vertices and a collection of edges that connect a pair of vertices

Anomalies: self-loop and parallel edge

An edge connect 2 vertices = vertices are adjacent to one other, edge is incident to both vertices

Degree of vertex = number of edges incident to it

Subgraph = subset of graph's edge that make up graph

A path = sequence of vertices connect by edges.

simple path = one with no repeated vertices.

A cycle is a path with at least 1 edge whose first and last vertices are the same ( can be more then 2 edges connect to the same first and last vertices)

A simple cycle = cycle with no repeated edge of vertices(less or equal then 2 edges connect to same last and first vertices).

A connected graph = there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph.

A not-connected graph = consist of a set of connected components.

Connected component = maximal connected subgraph.

An acyclic graph = graph with no cycles.

Tree = an acyclic connected graph.

Forest = disjoint set of trees.

Spanning tree of connect graph = subgraph contains all of the graph's vertices and is a single tree.

Spanning forest = union of spanning trees of its connected component

edge-weighted graph =  graph where edge are associated or cosr

spanning tree = connected subgraph with no cycle that include all vertices

minimum spanning tree = a spanning tree whose weight is the min

Principle of tree:
1/ Adding an edge connecting 2 vertices in a tree creates a unique cycle
2/ Removing an edge from a tree breaks tree into 2 separate sub-tree

Cut of a graph(MST) = partition MST's vertices into 2 non empty disjoint sets

Crossing edge of a cut = edge connecting a vertex in 1 set with a vertex in the other
