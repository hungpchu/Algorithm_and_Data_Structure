Symbol tables = dictionaries
In dictionaries, key is a word and its value = entry associated with the words that having definition
Symbol tables = indices
3 classic data structure supports the symbol table implementation: binary search tree, red-black tree and hash tables
Purpose of symbol table = associate a value with a key.
-> client can insert key-value pairs into symbol table then they can search for the value associated with key

A symbol table = data structure for key-value pairs that support 2 operation: insert(put) a new pair into the table
and search(get) the values associated with a given key

Choices for implementation for symbol table:
1/ Generics
2/ Duplicate keys:
  only 1 value is associated with each key(no duplicate keys in the table)
  when clients put a new value already associated with an existing ky then the
  new value replace the old one
3/ Null Key: keys can not be null
4/ Null value: no key can be associated with null value
5/ Deletion: put(key, null)
6/ Iteration

The equal keys are allowed in priority minQueue but not in the symbol table

Binary Search takes <= logN + 1 time
