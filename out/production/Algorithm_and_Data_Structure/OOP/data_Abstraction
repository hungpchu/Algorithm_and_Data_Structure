Data type = set of values and operations
Java program is based on building the reference types with the Java class
-> known as OOP with the concept of object - an entity holds data type value
-> Define own data type

ADT-Abstract data type is a data type whose representation is hidden from the client
-> Implement ADT: focus on the data then implement the operations on the data

API for abstract data type:
1/ operations(instance method) lack static modifier since its main purpose is operate on the data

Static method:
1/ implement function
2/ start with a class name
3/ used within different class
4/ belong to class


Non-static method:
1/ implement data-type operations
2/ start with an object name
3/ belongs to object
