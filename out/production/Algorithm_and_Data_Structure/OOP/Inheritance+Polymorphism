Inheritance :
1/ relationship among objects
2/ kinda against the data abstraction and encapsulation

subtyping = specify the relationship between unrelated classes by specify in an interface
a set of common methods that each implementing class must contain

Interface = list of instance methods
For instance:
public interface Datable{
  int month();
  int year();
}

Refer to our implemented code:
public class Date implements Datable{}

Interface inheritance:
1/ allow client program to manipulate objects of any types that implements the interface
2/ Basically allow client program to access to the instance variable of object implementing the interface through instance method

Polymorphism:
Implementing inheritance:
subclassing:
1/ enable programmers to change behaviour or add functionality without rewrite the entire class from the beginning
2/ define a new class(subclass) that inherits instance methods and instance variable from another class(superclass)

Subclass(lop con):
1/ contains more methods than the superclass(lop me)
2/ redefine or override methods in the superclass
Example:
class Super{}
class Sub extend Super{}
