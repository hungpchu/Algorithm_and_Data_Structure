OOP = Objected-oriented Programming

1/ Data encapsulation: data hiding
Data in this class is hidden from other classes
Example: declare variable as private

2/ Data abstract:
Hide implementation details from user(developers)
Functions will be provided to users.
Example:

 public abstract class Employee{} -> can not init
 public class Salary extends Employee{} -> can init

3/ Polymorphism: object takes many form, child class refer to parent class.
Example:
public interface Vegie{}
public class Animals{}
public class Deer extends Animals implement Vegie{}

4/ Interface: refer type in Java, collect of abstract method.
Class implements an interface -> inherit abstract method of the interface
No need 4 the abstract keyword.
Use interface as signing contract.

5/ Inheritance: 1 class obtain the properties of another classes.
use the "extend" keyword to inherit
Example:
class Super{}
class Sub extend Super{}
