LinkedList is a linear data structure which consists of nodes holding a data field and a reference to another node
Time complexity:

Access, Searching: O(n)
insert, delete:O(1)

Space complexity: O(n)

Linked list= recursive data structure that is either null or a reference to a node having generic item and a reference to a linked list
