0/ Combinatorial search:
    -/ Known: search space is exponential in size


1/ Exhaustive search:
    -/ iterate through all elements of a search space
2/ Backtracking:
    -/ method for examing the feasible solutions of a problem with the eliminating of
    infeasible solutions
    -/ can make search space to reasonable size
