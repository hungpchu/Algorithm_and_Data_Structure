Program design = process of converting a set of requirements into collection of commands or program that can
be executed on a computer system

Program = set of instruction that the computer executes to perform the meaningful work

Top down design = approach to program design that start with the general concept first and
repeatedly breaks it down in to its component parts.
For example:
Create the prime factorization of 1540. Then the step will be
1/ 1540
2/ 2 x 770
3/ 2 x 2 x 385

Bottom up Design = starts with the component parts and repeatedly combines them to achieve
the general concept
For instance from the above example:
1/ 2 x 2 x 5 x 7 x 11
