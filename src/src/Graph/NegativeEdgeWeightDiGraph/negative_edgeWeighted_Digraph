When the negative weights present, low-weight shortest paths have more edges than higher-weight paths.

Negative cycle in an edge weight digraph is a directed cycle whose total weight is negative

There exists a shortest path from s to v in an edge-weighted digraph if and only if there exists at least one directed path from s to v and no vertex on any directed path from s to v is on a negative cycle.
