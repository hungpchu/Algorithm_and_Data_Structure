1/ You have 2 ropes and each takes 1 hour to burn. How to use them to time 15 minute?

Solution:
    1/ Light rope 1 at both end take 30 minute with both end gone
    2/ Light rope 2 at 1 end take 30 minute with one end left
    3/ After 30 minute, rope 1 is completely burn and we know we have 30 minute to burn the other un burned half
    of rope 2
    4/ We burn the other end of rope 2 which will take 15 minute

2/ Eight are of the same weight, and one is heavier. You are given a balance which tells you only whether
the left side or the right side is heavier. Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale.

Solution:
    Divide the balls into sets of three items each.
    With a rule: given N balls, where N is divisible by 3, one use of the scale will point us to a set of X balls with the heavy ball.
    For the final set of 3 balls, put 1 balls off and weight 2 balls-> if 2 balls are equal then pick the 3rd one
