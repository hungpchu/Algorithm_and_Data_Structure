Deadlock:
situation where a thread is waiting for an object lock that another thread holds
each thread wait for the other thread to give up a lock
-> both threads remains waiting forever

Conditions for deadlock:
1/ Mutual exclusion: only 1 process can access a resource at a given time

2/ Hold and wait: process already holding a resource can request additional resources

3/ No preemption(Không có quyền ưu tiên): 1 process cannot be forcibly remove other process's resource

4/ Circular wait(Chờ thông tư): 2 or more processes form a circular chain where each process wait on another resource in the chain

Deadlock prevention:
remove above condition
most algorithm focus on circular wait
