Binary Searching Tree:
Time complex:
access, insert, delete, search:O(logn)

Space complex: O(n)

Binary search tree = a symbol table implementation combining the flexibility of insert
in linked-list and the efficiency of search in ordered array
-> Using 2 links per node leads to efficient symbol table implement

Binary seach tree satisfies the condition that bigger than root will be on the right and smaller than
root will be on the left

Binary search tree represents a set of keys and associated values

Binary search tree keeps the key in order

Binary Search Tree still has poor worst case performance
Insert + search = O(N)
